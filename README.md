How to use RNBOâ€“A workshop for ADC 2022

## Rough outline

- How to get RNBO
-- You've already got RNBO, it's installed in Max 8
-- (Maybe) you can have a short term license for the workshop

- RNBO Basics
-- Creating a rnbo~ object
-- Getting sound in and out of RNBO
-- Using param to create something that you can modulate from the outside
-- Export this to a VST or something (might take a minute)

- C++ Export, making a command line tool.
-- I watched A Scanner Darkly on the plane, so I've been thinking about amplitude modulation I guess. 
-- You take this very simple patch and export it as a C++ file
-- Modulate a parameter from a C++ program

- C++ Export, custom VST
-- Moving JUCE stuff around so you can have your way with the code

- WASM Export
-- Online drum sampler maybe?

- Raspberry Pi Export
-- Mabye someone else can export to this fish. That would be cool.

- Hang out and answer questions?
