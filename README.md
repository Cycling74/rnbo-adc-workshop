How to use RNBOâ€“A workshop for ADC 2022

## Rough outline

- How to get RNBO
-- You've already got RNBO, it's installed in Max 8
-- (Maybe) you can have a short term license for the workshop

- I want to give you a feeling for what it's like to work with RNBO.
- So I'll try to cover how to work with the Max side of RNBO, but also how to do things with your RNBO export.

- Quickstart
-- You can just export this stupid thing to a VST, and then use that VST anywhere.

- C++ Export, making a command line tool.
-- I watched A Scanner Darkly on the plan, so I've been thinking about amplitude modulation I guess. 
-- You take this very simple patch and export it as a C++ file
